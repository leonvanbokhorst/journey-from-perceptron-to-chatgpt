# Module 5: Data for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning and Attention Mechanisms

This directory contains data files used in Module 5 exercises.

## Contents

For the neural machine translation exercises, you can download the following datasets:

- **Simplified English-French Pairs**: A small dataset of English-French sentence pairs for demonstration purposes
- **Multi30k**: A dataset with 30,000 sentence pairs (English-French, English-German) for machine translation tasks

The exercises in this module will generate synthetic data when appropriate, but for more realistic translation tasks,
you can download datasets from the following sources:

- The Multi30k dataset: [https://github.com/multi30k/dataset](https://github.com/multi30k/dataset)
- WMT datasets: [http://www.statmt.org/wmt20/](http://www.statmt.org/wmt20/)
- OPUS collection: [http://opus.nlpl.eu/](http://opus.nlpl.eu/)
